# Immutables: a 2D raster game

# Rules

One playing field, many players

Playing field is a rectangular grid.

Each player controls a brush which can move with a fixed velocity along each axis. Each player has her own brush color.

A player can start drawing by pressing a Space button and moving the brush.

If a player completes a closed figure, the figure is filled with that player's color.

The goal is to color as much of the playing field as possible.
